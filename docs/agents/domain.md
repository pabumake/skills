# Domain docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists. It points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**. Read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill, reached through `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`, creates them when terms or decisions get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│   └── 0002-postgres-write-model.md
└── src/
```

Multi-context repo, indicated by `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
└── src/
    ├── ordering/
    │   ├── CONTEXT.md
    │   └── docs/adr/                  ← context-specific decisions
    └── billing/
        ├── CONTEXT.md
        └── docs/adr/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name, use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept isn't in the glossary, reconsider whether you're inventing language the project doesn't use. If it is a real gap, note it for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, state the conflict instead of silently overriding it:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because..._
